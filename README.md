Hi,
This program is a Library application

This library application is a program model of GUI / interface for a database and database design 
using SQL as its basic database framework. 

To run this program, you need to integrate an external library for Java called mysqlconnector,
You may download this connector here https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/

The example of data that this program used can be found in the inlamningsuppgift.txt,
Kindly execute (run) all of the sql command in the inlamningsuppgift.txt before you use the program
to ensure the database set in the program and in your computer matches.

You can also find the initial code without the GUI inside the Main class under the comment section
