Hi,
This program is a Library application model

This library application is a program model of GUI / interface for a database and database design 
using SQL as its basic database framework. 

To run this program, you need to integrate an external library for Java called mysqlconnector,
You may download this connector here https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/

The example of database data that this program used can be found in the inlamningsuppgift.txt.
Kindly execute (run) all of the sql commansd in the inlamningsuppgift.txt before you use the program
to ensure the database set in the program and in your computer matches. You can use the SQL generator
Table Plus to run all of the sql commands, which you may download here https://tableplus.com/download

If you would like to try to run the program without the GUI, you may also do so by using the code 
sections at the bottom of the Main.java page with title Initial Code without GUI.
